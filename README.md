Important:
The private directory in this repo is "data" (which, if you're looking at a public version, does not and should not exist). All sensitive info should go to that directory.
Please make sure "data" is in .gitignore, and double check every time that nothing in that directory is commited before pushing to git origin.
For how to setup:
Please read setup.sh in the root directory.
